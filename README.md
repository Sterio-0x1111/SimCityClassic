# SimCityClassic
This is a "replica" of a game from the year 1989.

The current functional version is 1.0.0-alpha, while the version in the repository is Alpha 5.0.0V.

## Possible occurring errors
- In the settings, it may happen that some buttons do not work; in that case, simply press the next working button.
- In the current version, it is not possible to display the input of name and time (create a city).
- You can, however, confirm with the Enter key. In the case of the 'name' input, characters must not exceed 10 characters, and special characters like "â˜¼" are not allowed.
- When entering the time, an input of 1 to 99999 is possible.

## The loading of a city
For this, first, the JSON for the map must be selected, and then the settings.

Example:
- ../map/{name}
- ../setting/{name}
